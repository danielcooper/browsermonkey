<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
'>Browser monkey is an HTML browser designed for opening HTML 4.1 compliant
files with a subset of HTML rendering functionality, defined by the user
requirements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
'>Browser monkey has a plethora of features that allow
the user to experience the features of a high end browser in a lightweight
package. It was designed to be used in tractors by agricultural workers.
As such, the interface and list of features browser monkey encompasses have been
carefully selected to maximize usability and efficiency. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
 
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
'>Browser monkey allows the user to access the <i>internet</i>, <i>zoom</i> 
on text, click <i>links</i>and <i>search</i> the page of an item.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1>Features</h1>
 
<h2>Search</h2>
 
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
'>Browser monkey features a search system that can be
activated by clicking the search bar and typing the information that needs to
be searched. This allows you to find a specific item within a document. Once the
<i>Search</i> button is pressed, the matches to the search term will be
highlighted in green, with the status of the amount of matches found at the bottom
of the page.</span></p>

<IMG SRC="searchFound.jpg">

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>However if nothing 
is found a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>status update</i> at the bottom of 
the screen will signify the current state of the browser.</span></p>

<IMG SRC="searchNFound.jpg">

<h2>Zoom</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>
The browser features a zooming system activated by the user by pressing either the
positive or negative icons. The zoom levels available (as percentages) are: 50, 60,
70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, and 300. This allows the user to see more
items on the page by zooming out or see the page in more detail by zooming in.</span></p>
<p style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The following shows the zoom in action:</p>

<h3>Zoomed in to 300%</h3>
<IMG SRC="300Zoom.jpg">

<h3>Zoomed out to 50%</h3>
<IMG SRC="50Zoom.jpg">

<h2>Images</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Images can also be displayed in our Browser, this allows
the engineers to use diagrams in their manual pages, and allows more full viewing of the web.</span></p>


<h2>Clickable links</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Some words and phrases in the documentation allow the user
to move from one page to another. If a phrase is highlighted blue with an underline, you can click the link and move to a new page.</span></p>

<IMG SRC="link.jpg">

<h3>Internet capability</h3>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In order to access the internet simply enter a URL
into the <i>Address</i> bar, the browser
will take it from there provided you have a working internet connection. Once
on the website mentioned, you can again, click links to navigate through the
website.</span></p>

<IMG SRC="internetCap.jpg">

<h2>Loading files</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>If you wish to access any saved HTML WebPages, simply
click on the <i>Browse</i> button. This will
then bring up a file locator for ease of use.</span></p>

<IMG SRC="load.jpg">

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>
Alternatively it is possible to load files by just typing in the full address of the 
location into the <i>address</i> bar. For example:<br><i>file:/C:/Users/admin/Desktop/BrowserMonkey/live%20life.txt</i>
<br>or<br>
<i>C:\Users\admin\Desktop\BrowserMonkey\live life.txt</i> (like
a standard path)<br><br> Loading from the <i>command
line</i> is also possible, by typing<i>java -jar BrowserMonkey.jar &quot;specificStartPage.html&quot;</i>
defining the start page for the browser.</span></p>

<h2>Google Search</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>If you need to search for something using Google,
you can simply input queries from BrowserMonkey's address bar. Just type in &quot;<i>g search term</i>&quot; and
Browser Monkey will automatically search your query in Google (mobile) for you. This allows web searches even though
web forms aren’t supported.</span></p>

<h2>Log File</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The log file stores any errors identified with
the currently used HTML document. This allows engineers to see any incorrect code and correct it if they wish.</span></p>

<IMG SRC="logFile.jpg">

<h2>Error Detection and Correction</h2>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The error detection identifies where tags have not
been closed properly, amongst other HTML conformance errors. These problems are taken down in the form of a log file,
allowing the engineer to make changes to their code to better suit the browser. However, the browser corrects many of
these mistakes before rendering, so it is flexible to inconsistencies with the HTML specification.</span></p>
